I've never developed a website by working under the hood before, so this is a
new experience for me. Thanks very much to [Ben
Moore](http://blm.io/blog/markdown-academic-cv/), [Karl
Broman](http://kbroman.org/simple_site/), and [Jonathan
McGlone](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) for their useful tutorials
and code.
